What do you look for in a game?

freedom of doing whatever.
Customize stories. Path changes story line.
Back and do a different experience. (until dawn)
bulid your own character.
skills point
Save points? 
	-check point only saving at certain at points
	or saving anytime. (resident evil) vs (minecraft)
ability to have interaction with everything.
	emphasis on freedom.
external harddive / in the background storage but also allow the user to save to pc.

tutorial: basic -> to everything. 
Menu : start new -> tutorial
	saved game -> look up tutorials for specific things.

Ark survival -> no explaination on how to play. Confusing no tutorial, deters people bc they dont know what to do.

minecraft -> straight forward. Progress story whenever.
combo moves vs simplicity moves? 
	- simple combo moves... mariokart
